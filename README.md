## React Portfolio

## Description 
In this project, I created a dynamic portfolio in React and deployed to Github Pages. This project consisted of utilizing React components, Routes, and Bootstrap for styling. The portfolio includes a list of projects with their corresponding Github links, a Contact form, and a downloadable resume.
